### üéì **Lecture 2: Advanced Linux Basics and System Management**

**Objective:** Deepen understanding of the Linux command line with advanced file manipulation, user management, and process management.

---

#### 1. üóÇÔ∏è **File Manipulation and Redirection**

**Objective:** Learn how to manipulate file content, use pipes, and redirect output.

**Commands to Practice:**

1. **`cp`** - Copy files and directories.  
   Example: `cp file1.txt /home/user/`  
   Example (copying directory): `cp -r my_project /home/user/`

2. **`mv`** - Move or rename files and directories.  
   Example: `mv file1.txt file2.txt`  
   Example (move directory): `mv my_project /home/user/`

3. **`echo`** - Output text to the terminal or a file.  
   Example: `echo "Linux is fun!" > output.txt`  
   Example (append): `echo "More content" >> output.txt`

4. **`cat`, `tac`, `head`, `tail`** - View content with options to reverse, view top/bottom lines, etc.  
   Example (reverse): `tac file.txt`  
   Example (first 10 lines): `head file.txt`  
   Example (last 10 lines): `tail file.txt`  
   Example (last N lines): `tail -n 5 file.txt`

5. **`tee`** - Redirect output to a file while displaying it on the terminal.  
   Example: `echo "Hello World" | tee output.txt`

**Practical Task:**

- Copy a file to another directory, rename it, and then view the top and bottom content of the file.
- Use `echo` to append text to a file, and verify the output with `cat`.

#### 2. üë§ **User and Group Management**

**Objective:** Learn how to create and manage users and groups.

**Commands to Practice:**

1. **`useradd`** - Create a new user.  
   Example: `sudo useradd john`

2. **`passwd`** - Change a user‚Äôs password.  
   Example: `sudo passwd john`

3. **`usermod`** - Modify a user‚Äôs account.  
   Example: `sudo usermod -aG sudo john` (adds the user to the sudo group)

4. **`groupadd`** - Create a new group.  
   Example: `sudo groupadd devs`

5. **`groups`** - List groups a user is part of.  
   Example: `groups john`

6. **`chgrp`** - Change group ownership of a file.  
   Example: `sudo chgrp devs file1.txt`

**Practical Task:**

- Create a new user and a group.
- Add the user to the group and verify it using the `groups` command.
- Change the group ownership of a file to the newly created group.

#### 3. üñ•Ô∏è **Process Management**

**Objective:** Learn how to monitor and control system processes.

**Commands to Practice:**

1. **`ps`** - Display current processes.  
   Example: `ps aux` (view all running processes)

2. **`top`** - Monitor real-time system processes.  
   Example: `top` (interactive process viewer)

3. **`kill`** - Terminate a process by PID.  
   Example: `kill 1234` (where 1234 is the process ID)

4. **`killall`** - Terminate processes by name.  
   Example: `killall firefox`

5. **`bg`, `fg`** - Move processes between background and foreground.  
   Example: `bg` (send process to background)  
   Example: `fg` (bring process to foreground)

6. **`nohup`** - Run a command in the background, even after logging out.  
   Example: `nohup python3 script.py &`

**Practical Task:**

- Launch a process (e.g., a text editor), then use `ps` and `top` to monitor it.
- Terminate the process using the `kill` command.

#### 4. üíæ **Disk Management**

**Objective:** Understand how to manage disk space and partitions.

**Commands to Practice:**

1. **`df`** - Display disk space usage.  
   Example: `df -h` (human-readable format)

2. **`du`** - Display disk usage of files and directories.  
   Example: `du -sh my_project/` (total size of the directory)

3. **`fdisk`** - Partition a disk.  
   Example: `sudo fdisk /dev/sda`

4. **`mount`, `umount`** - Mount and unmount file systems.  
   Example (mount): `sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`  
   Example (unmount): `sudo umount /mnt`

5. **`lsblk`** - List available block devices.  
   Example: `lsblk`

**Practical Task:**

- Use `df` to check disk usage and `du` to check the size of a specific directory.
- List the block devices on your system with `lsblk`.

#### 5. üîÑ **System Updates and Package Management**

**Objective:** Learn how to update the system and manage packages.

**Commands to Practice:**

1. **`apt update`** - Update package lists (Debian/Ubuntu-based).  
   Example: `sudo apt update`

2. **`apt upgrade`** - Upgrade installed packages.  
   Example: `sudo apt upgrade`

3. **`apt install`** - Install a package.  
   Example: `sudo apt install vim`

4. **`dpkg`** - Manage individual Debian packages.  
   Example: `sudo dpkg -i package.deb`

5. **`apt remove`** - Remove a package.  
   Example: `sudo apt remove vim`

**Practical Task:**

- Update your package list and upgrade any available packages.
- Install and remove a package (e.g., Vim).
